								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Branding is one of the most important aspects of any business, large or small, retail or B2B. An effective brand strategy gives you a major edge in increasingly competitive markets. But what exactly does &#8220;branding&#8221; mean? How does it affect a small business like yours?</p>
<p>Simply put, your brand is your promise to your customer. It tells them what they can expect from your products and services, and it differentiates your offering from your competitors&#8217;. Your brand is derived from who you are, who you want to be and who people perceive you to be.</p>
<p>Are you the innovative maverick in your industry? Or the experienced, reliable one? Is your product the high-cost, high-quality option, or the low-cost, high-value option? You can&#8217;t be both, and you can&#8217;t be all things to all people. Who you are should be based to some extent on who your target customers want and need you to be.</p>
<p>The foundation of your brand is your logo. Your website, packaging and promotional materials&#8211;all of which should integrate your logo&#8211;communicate your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Brand Strategy &amp; Equity</strong><br />
Your brand strategy is how, what, where, when and to whom you plan on communicating and delivering on your brand messages. Where you advertise is part of your brand strategy. Your distribution channels are also part of your brand strategy. And what you communicate visually and verbally are part of your brand strategy, too.</p>
<p>Consistent, strategic branding leads to a strong brand equity, which means the added value brought to your company&#8217;s products or services that allows you to charge more for your brand than what identical, unbranded products command. The most obvious example of this is Coke vs. a generic soda. Because Coca-Cola has built a powerful brand equity, it can charge more for its product&#8211;and customers will pay that higher price.</p>
<p>The added value intrinsic to brand equity frequently comes in the form of perceived quality or emotional attachment. For example, Nike associates its products with star athletes, hoping customers will transfer their emotional attachment from the athlete to the product. For Nike, it&#8217;s not just the shoe&#8217;s features that sell the shoe.</p>
<p><strong>Defining Your Brand</strong><br />
Defining your brand is like a journey of business self-discovery. It can be difficult, time-consuming and uncomfortable. It requires, at the very least, that you answer the questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your company&#8217;s mission?</li>
<li>What are the benefits and features of your products or services?</li>
<li>What do your customers and prospects already think of your company?</li>
<li>What qualities do you want them to associate with your company?</li>
</ul>
<p>Do your research. Learn the needs, habits and desires of your current and prospective customers. And don&#8217;t rely on what you think they think. Know what they think.</p>
<p>Because defining your brand and developing a brand strategy can be complex, consider leveraging the expertise of a nonprofit small-business advisory group or a Small Business Development Center .</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve defined your brand, how do you get the word out? Here are a few simple, time-tested tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get a great logo.</strong> Place it everywhere.</li>
<li><strong>Write down your brand messaging.</strong> What are the key messages you want to communicate about your brand? Every employee should be aware of your brand attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Integrate your brand.</strong> Branding extends to every aspect of your business&#8211;how you answer your phones, what you or your salespeople wear on sales calls, your e-mail signature, everything.</li>
<li><strong>Create a &#8220;voice&#8221; for your company that reflects your brand.</strong> This voice should be applied to all written communication and incorporated in the visual imagery of all materials, online and off. Is your brand friendly? Be conversational. Is it ritzy? Be more formal. You get the gist.</li>
<li><strong>Develop a tagline.</strong> Write a memorable, meaningful and concise statement that captures the essence of your brand.</li>
<li><strong>Design templates and create brand standards for your marketing materials.</strong> Use the same color scheme, logo placement, look and feel throughout. You don&#8217;t need to be fancy, just consistent.</li>
<li><strong>Be true to your brand.</strong> Customers won&#8217;t return to you&#8211;or refer you to someone else&#8211;if you don&#8217;t deliver on your brand promise.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent.</strong> I placed this point last only because it involves all of the above and is the most important tip I can give you. If you can&#8217;t do this, your attempts at establishing a brand will fail.</li>
</ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brand extensions are more than twice as likely to succeed as new brands. With mega-brands like Crest extending to more than 80 SKUs in the United States alone and over 300 products worldwide, today&#8217;s brands are not just expanding-they are hyper-proliferating.</p>
<p>Brand identity architectures-and the design strategies that define them-are rarely planned to accommodate this hyperbolic explosion. In an effort to differentiate their various tiers, firms may use design strategies that overstep their needs. In the best cases, these ill-planned design architectures close the door on future brand growth. In the worst cases, over-extended design architectures actually denigrate the base brand&#8217;s integrity.</p>
<p>The most successful brands leverage their relevance across a number of meaningful experiences, attracting a broad range of consumer profiles without eroding the brand&#8217;s essence. In their initial evolution, brands offer core users variations of the same experience. As they grow, many brands offer core consumers completely new, but relevant experiences. When they are more fully evolved, idealized brands leverage their core attributes to both new consumers and new experiences. And when a brand&#8217;s values become so richly engrained in the culture, the brand&#8217;s reputation can credibly endorse unrelated brands, too, while still building on base-brand credibility.</p>
<p>Certainly not all brands are relevant enough, nor all brand experiences rich enough, to extend to all tiers. Regardless, all ideal brand identity architectures effectively differentiate each brand offering while actually building on the brand&#8217;s integrity. In this article, we&#8217;ll show how it&#8217;s done by using two examples: the first is Lean Cuisine, an actual, established brand of frozen entrees, and Sunshine Grove, a fictional brand of orange juice created for illustrative purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Hierarchy of design strategies: colors, shapes, numbers, words</strong><br />
Audiences typically respond to a specific hierarchy of communication. In this hierarchy, visual language is far more eloquent than verbal communication. In visual communication, color is first element observed, generating the most immediate visceral and emotional response. Successful design architecture&#8217;s single most effective strategy is to establish a distinctive color relevant to the brand experience and use that color consistently. Changing brand color should only be reserved for the highest level of differentiation.<br />
Lean Cuisine Photo</p>
<p>Well-planned design architectures might use color in a number of primary, secondary and even tertiary strategies. For example, the white color is Lean Cuisine&#8217;s core brand mnemonic used consistently across all products, while the very subtle use of supportive colors effectively segments the brand tiers.</p>
<p><strong>Shape</strong> is the second most recognized visual strategy. Again, shape can be part of the primary (i.e., package structure), secondary (layout of graphic elements) and tertiary strategies (brand logos or icons). Using the Lean Cuisine example, the layout of elements remains identical across more than 100 SKUs. Each element is in exactly the same &#8220;staging area,&#8221; resulting in a recognizable brand shape that helps consumers navigate quickly. The package structure or layout shape only changes to differentiate very unique brand offerings.</p>
<p><strong>Numbers</strong> are the third most immediately recognized strategy. Numbers are most effective for differentiating good/better/best brand tiers. For instance, most consumers recognize the value differences between 200-, 500- and 700-series automobiles.</p>
<p>.<br />
Words are the last to be recognized and the least visceral of all cues, and therefore should not be relied on to create meaningful differentiation across the brand. As in Lean Cuisine&#8217;s case, brand segment names, such as Everyday Favorites and Café Classics, are relatively small, allowing the distinctive color bands that wrap them to signal each tier more effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Putting best practice to use</strong><br />
What follows is an outline of sequential best practices for building optimized brand identity architectures. Ten possible tiers are defined both by the criteria used to determine their place in the brand hierarchy and by some of the design strategies used to best achieve their balanced, branded differentiation.<br />
Lean Cuisine and Stouffer&#8217;s (both owned by Nestlé), as well as our fictional Sunshine Grove brand of juices, are referred to as mentors. Note that they are used exclusively to exemplify branding strategy. These examples may not be actual products nor do they indicate Nestlé&#8217;s desires to extend their brands. They are used as hypothetical examples, purely to illustrate each tier of a balanced brand architecture.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s world is cluttered with messages. In this enviromnent, Rob Wallace urges simplicity. Powerful brands cut through perceptional noise with a memorably iconic and minimalist approach to colors and symbols. Case studies amplify the principles he advocates, and a three-step process outlines specific criteria managers can use to build designs that are visually clean and engaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;SimplicitY is complexity resolved.&#8221; -Constantin Brancusi, Romanian Minimalist sculptor</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the common thread that unifies the best brand identities? Quick- think of Target. What immediately comes to mind? If you&#8217;re like many people, you thought of Target&#8217;s red, iconic symbol. Do you remember anything else about their ads? How quickly can you distinguish a Target message from other messages?</p>
<p>How about Cingular? What color and shape comes to mind? What does that brand stand for? On the product design side, picture OXO Good Grips hand-held appliances. What rational and emotional connections does that brand evoke? How did OXO take ergonomics and elevate it to the status of a brand icon?</p>
<p>How is it that all these powerful brands connect so instantly. so deeply with their core consumers? Each of them uses a singular visual focus with a distinctive palette of colors and icons and lots of white space. Each strongly stands for one thing. By simplifying their message, they not only cut through the clutter, but they also encourage consumers to bring their own personal interpretations to the brand.</p>
<p><strong>Over-Extension = Clutter = Confusion</strong><br />
In today&#8217;s information-overloaded culture, where brands have proliferated like rabbits, the mass retail environment has become visual junk food, leaving us overfed and undernourished.</p>
<p>To help their own brands stand out against this cacophony, marketers are increasingly challenged to find an as-yet-unmet consumer need or a truly distinctive product benefit. Saying this is difficult is an understatement. Rather than invent a new mousetrap, most marketers would choose the line of least resistance by simply bundling a series of brand benefits in a new way. Well that may be easier, but it is also less effective. Adding more to the brand message simply complicates it and only amplifies the visual noise at shelf.</p>
<p>Even the most astute marketers fall into this trap. Look at Crest toothpaste, for example. In the early 1980s, Procter &amp; Gamble offered Crest in a handful of well-segmented primary variants. Today, the brand extends to well over a dozen variants in nine flavors and more than 80 SKUs worldwide. Many of these products rebundle the same set of benefits. Do we really need Crest Whitening Plus Scope Citrus Splash when we have Crest Whitening Expressions Lemon Ice?</p>
<p>These complex brand messages not only get lost, they also confuse consumers: &#8220;Damn, does Tom like Strong Mint, Mild Mint, or Peppermint? Oh, wait-what about Vanilla Mint?~ In the best case, this confusion merely disengages consumers. In the worst case, they buy another, simpler brand.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Is the New Better</strong><br />
An emerging trend to combat this visual chatter has now hit the mainstream. The most successful brands are able to connect with their core enthusiasts by using an effective visual shorthand. Using color, symbols, icons, and a singular focus, these brands cut through the visual noise. The key strategy they share is simplicity in their messages, their identities, and their communications architectures.</p>
<p><strong>Proven by Science</strong><br />
New consumer behavior science supports the trend toward simplification. Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s latest book, Blink, sets out to prove how we, as twenty-first-century human beings, respond to stimuli. His research suggests that we &#8220;thin-slice&#8221; through the myriad of messages that bombard us constantly. We filter out everything except the most meaningful visual message- the one that strikes us on an emotional level.</p>
<p>Gladwell&#8217;s research contends that this instantaneous reaction goes far beyond the choices we make about which brand to buy-in fact, it drives all our decisions.</p>
<p>Prove this to yourself. Monitor your own personal decisions, specifically those that surround your brand choices. If you&#8217;re like me, you walk into a well-constructed retail experience with the intent to purchase five things, but you walk out with 15. Gladwell would have you believe that 10 of those purchase decisions were made in a single instant, at an instinctive level, inspired by simple visual cues.</p>
<p><strong>Proven in the Real World</strong><br />
Simplicity is not a fad or even a trend, but a tectonic shift in both consumer experience and brand culture. Here&#8217;s why. When a brand experience is stripped of all its prescriptive messages, the consumer must engage it in a highly personal way. A simple visual icon, versus lots of words, allows for individual interpretation-a sense of individual &#8220;realness.&#8221; In a &#8220;my space&#8221; consumer culture that increasingly demands personalized brand experiences, this individual interpretation becomes all the more important. In a society of mass customization, only the simple can become the &#8220;my.&#8221;</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all know that branding is a vital part of building a successful online business.<br />
Cohesive, modern branding helps lend credibility and professionalism to your online presence, which is key when you’re trying to get your name out there and start cultivating a community.</p>
<p>But, when does branding go beyond simply lending legitimacy to your business? What elements of branding actually have the power to move the needle when it comes to expanding your audience, or &#8211; even better &#8211; your revenue?</p>
<p>In my experience, I’ve found that three different factors lead to varying levels of effectiveness in brand design.</p>
<p>They are attention, understanding and resonance.<br />
But, the major catch here is that all three of these are NOT created equal. Each one conveys a different level of connection between your company and someone who comes across your brand, contributing to whether that person becomes a paying customer/client. (And we can all agree paying customers/clients is a very good thing, right? Right.)</p>
<p>Let’s dive into each factor, but first I want to paint a little picture for you.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re strolling through Times Square on a busy day. Every 20 feet or so you run into a different street performer, each one vying for your attention. Some are aggressive, some are boring, some are intriguing and others are just flat out entertaining.</p>
<p>The truth is, though, they all have the same goal in mind: to get you to stop walking, hang out for a while, and eventually to drop some cash into their hats.</p>
<p>Hmmm… stop, hang out for a while, and offer up some money. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Yep, that’s online business in a nutshell, my friends.</p>
<p>Think about it. That’s all any of us is trying to do: go out there, put on our best show, and try to capture the hearts of people browsing the web so we can create a profitable business.</p>
<p>Now, as any good street performer knows, if you’re going to get someone to give you a few bucks, you’re first going to need them to stop walking and pay attention.</p>
<p>Which brings me to our first factor:</p>
<h2>1. Attention</h2>
<p>If branding was a video game, Attention would be Level One. (Yep, for those of you keeping track at home, that’s street performers and video games. What can I say? I’m trying to keep it interesting for ya!)</p>
<p>It’s no secret that, as a culture, our attention spans are as fleeting as ever, and if you have any hope of building an audience, you first have to get on their radar. The mission of Level One is to use your brand to simply stand out in the sea of your competitors.</p>
<p>I love how Seth Godin defines the term “brand” on his blog:</p>
<p>“A brand is the set of expectations, memories, stories and relationships that, taken together, account for a consumer’s decision to choose one product or service over another.”</p>
<p>Inherently in his definition, Seth implies that the whole point of developing a brand is to rise above your peers. (Peers are more commonly referred to as &#8220;competitors&#8221; but I hate the idea of reinforcing that comparison mindset, so let&#8217;s instead say &#8220;differentiate yourself within the peer landscape.&#8221;) But to do that, you first have to be seen.</p>
<p>This means doing research. Take a look at the various businesses in your industry. In what ways are they zigging that you could be zagging?</p>
<p>Be careful, though. Make sure that whatever branding you develop comes from an authentic place, not just an interest in standing out from the pack. Don’t drench your site in neon colors just because you don’t see anyone else in your category doing it. If you do that and you’re a watercolor artist that sells pastel florals, your brand is going to feel dissonant with your business foundation. On the other hand, if you’re a fun and energetic resource shop for creatives with vibrant in your brand name, it just might work. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>When my friends, Omar and Nicole started their business, The $100 MBA, they did so with the belief that they could challenge the norm when it comes to business education. The advice they give is practical and energetic. That mix of rebelliousness (challenging the norm) and energy/enthusiasm brings an underlying authenticity to their red, black and white brand color palette.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to ask yourself if you’re trying to achieve attention:</p>
<p>Does my branding stand out in a lineup of similar businesses in my category or niche?<br />
Would I stick around if I stumbled across a site like mine?<br />
Now, The only problem with striving for a brand that only aims to garner attention is that it’s fleeting. A flashy street performer might be able to make you stop for five minutes to watch, but unless there’s something to keep you there, then you’ll eventually just move on, right? If you’re only attempting to gain attention, it’s likely that whatever traffic you do manage to get will come and go.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the next level of branding achievement &#8211; understanding.</p>
<h2>2. Understanding</h2>
<p>Once you have the attention of someone, if you want any hope of keeping them engaged for the long haul, you’re going to have to effectively communicate what you do. Great branding should be designed to reinforce and support your company’s message. You can use elements in your brand identity to give contextual clues to your audience, letting them quickly decipher what your business is and if it might be for them.</p>
<p>Take Evernote, for example. I love the elephant icon in their logo because it reinforces the original purpose of their product, which is to help you keep track of and remember things. Though someone might not make the connection right away, if they see the logo in context, the elephant image is a memorable icon that supports the understanding of their product.</p>
<p>Image source</p>
<p>Branding not only has the power to enhance understanding of a product, it can also lead to a deeper understanding of a company’s differentiator (which is especially useful for a service-based company.)</p>
<p>Take the design studio, Ghostly Ferns, for example, a creative studio that declares on its website that it’s “Not your average design studio” and they only work with “happy companies.”</p>
<p>Aside from the large and direct brand statements, as a visitor to the website, I immediately notice that the branding is unexpected and whimsical. Not only have they grabbed my attention with a distinct, inspired brand, but now I understand that their aesthetic and differentiator is the unconventional nature of their designs and the value they place on friendly client relationships. The branding reinforces the communication, and if I leave the site, I walk away with a deeper insight into what their business is about.</p>
<p>Some questions to ask yourself if you’re trying to achieve understanding:</p>
<p>Does my brand have a tone or energy that is aligned with the basic facets of my business (who I’m trying to target, what my focus is, what I believe in?)<br />
Does my brand identity offer any clues as to what my business is about or who it’s for?<br />
Attention and understanding can be powerful, but I would argue that, most of the time, neither one is enough to ensure that a passerby converts into a customer &#8211;or better yet &#8212; a fan.</p>
<p>So, then, what turns a person from a casual visitor into a customer, a client, or a brand advocate? What makes the person in Times Square throw their fiver into a street performer’s hat, or &#8212; what’s even more powerful &#8212; go tell their friends about the experience they had with that one special performer?</p>
<p>The answer is resonance.</p>
<h2>3. Resonance</h2>
<p>You did it! You’ve made it to the final level of effective branding and if you can tackle the Boss &#8211; Brand Resonance &#8211; then you win the ultimate game reward: a brand advocate.</p>
<p>Resonance is all about going a step beyond speaking to someone’s mind and instead, speaking straight to their heart and their soul.<br />
As Simon Sinek poignantly said in his TEDx talk, Start With Why, “People don’t buy what you do, they buy WHY you do it.”</p>
<p>After working with dozens of branding clients &#8211; from solopreneurs to large marketing companies &#8211; one thing has become clear to me: crafting a powerful brand story is the first step in connecting with your brand’s true fans.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, when I say “brand story,” I’m referring to the unique narrative that conveys the heart and soul of your business. I like to think of brand story as the melting pot of answers to all those important, juicy, deeply-rooted questions about your business and what it stands for.</p>
<p><strong>Questions like:</strong></p>
<p>What does your business believe in?<br />
Why did you get started?<br />
Who are you passionate about serving and why?<br />
Why do you get up every morning excited about your business?<br />
Every place and way that you communicate that narrative &#8211; whether it’s through your brand identity (your logo, color palette, photography, typography, etc.), your copy, or an event experience &#8211; is an opportunity to make an emotional connection with a potential customer or client.</p>
<p>Brand resonance happens when the values and beliefs of a brand align with the values and beliefs of an individual.<br />
But, in order for brand resonance to occur, you have to invest the time in understanding what your beliefs and values are as a business. You have to know what you stand for and bake that into your brand. That’s what will give you the power to create lasting members of your tribe.</p>
<p>For example, this business, Made Vibrant, is based on the belief that when we show up as our truest, most vibrant selves, the world is a better place. It’s an imperfect process, but it’s about the growth we all experience along the way. This underlying belief is reflected in the bright and vibrant colors of my brand, and the emphasis on the imperfect process comes through in the hand-drawn elements seen throughout my branding. Those visuals, coupled with the direct, mission-driven copy, were intentionally created to resonate with creatives that are motivated to grow.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you how many emails I’ve received with sentences like:</p>
<p>“It’s like you were talking right to me!”<br />
“I found Made Vibrant at the perfect time!”<br />
“This is exactly what I needed.”</p>
<p>That is the exact kind of response you’re aiming for.</p>
<p>Resonance gets you an engaged audience and an engaged audience gets you clients, sales and revenue. Not only will people stick around to hear what you have to say, they’re going to buy, and &#8211; even better &#8211; they’re going to tell their friends to check you out too.</p>
<p>So, let’s recap:<br />
There’s attention. (“Ohh, look at that.”)<br />
There’s understanding. (“Ohh, I see what that company does.”)<br />
Then there’s resonance. (“Ohhh, that company GETS me.”)</p>
<p>Remember, branding isn’t JUST about your logo or the fonts you choose for your website. It’s the sum of every tangible and intangible connection someone has with your business.<br />
Most branding &#8211; even good branding &#8211; stops at levels one or two of this list. Good branding is well-designed, professional, attention-grabbing and aids in the communication of what a company does.</p>
<p>But excellent branding? Excellent branding transcends attention and understanding and hits you right in the heart.</p>
<p>I encourage you to take a look at your own branding and see where you stack up against each of these three levels.</p>
<p>If you’re dressed as a break-dancing grandma in Times Square, sure, I’ll probably stop for five minutes to watch you dance.</p>
<p>BUT, if you’re dressed as a break-dancing grandma in Times Square with a big photo of your own grandma beside you, wearing her track suit because she loved to dance and back in her heyday she taught you everything you know about break-dancing&#8230; well then HECK YEAH I’m going to give you my money. And HECK YEAH I’m going to remember you AND tell my friends about you because I love my grandma and she taught me things too.</p>
<p>Resonance, my friends. That is when your branding will truly start to move the needle.</p>
